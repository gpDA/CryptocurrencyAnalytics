# Objectives

#### Cryptocurrency Analytics is a web-app and tool to forecast the crypto currency market by looking at the pricing trends and following articles in response to the price changes. I've wanted Cryptocurrency investors to look at the pricing trends and articles generated from major news companies such as Reuters, CNN, WSJ ... When A user clicks on the pricing trends graph, the news articles on the specified day are appeared on the right box.

#### It is sometimes hard to find what causes the price changes in Cryptocurrency market. In this project, we did following steps to help people to find reasonings behind the price changes by showing relevant articles on a certain day.

* Datamining across numerous cryptocurrency exchanges globally
* Sentiment anlalysis on historical data sources using Watson API
* Interactive display of sentiment analysis and news articles

#### CryptocurrencyAnalytics was created as a final project for Projects in Programming & Data Science (INFO-UB.0024.01, Fall 2018) and we received a grade of A.
